Oh, a passenger, it's been a long 
time since... I haven't met any. In the 
past, people used to come here to harvest 
ore, but, uh, this... It's been a long time 
since anyone's been here. Indeed, several 
months ago, a group of miners went on an
expedition but only one of the members came 
back! When he told us what had happened, he
mentioned the presence of a mask bearing 
marks of demons. 
Bring me that mask and I'll analyze it and 
I'll give you a reward.
