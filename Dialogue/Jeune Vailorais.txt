The exit on my right leads to 
the Temple of the Abyss. 
We used to go there to pray to 
the god of fortune. 
But as you can imagine, the demons took this 
temple as one of their bases. 
Many believers have lost all hope 
and have allied themselves with 
the demons for their survival. 
But can we really blame them?
