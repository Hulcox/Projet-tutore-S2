Hmm, so it's you! You decide to make life 
hard for us, the servants of the demon king. 
So you're not cold-blooded.Of course not, 
we're in Hell. Mwahahahahah! Anyway, 
know that you are nothing in front of our 
Lord. He will bleed you as he has bled 
all those who dared to approach him. 
And it's certainly not a poor soldier from a 
small town that's going to change that. 
You'd better go home, for there is only 
death waiting for you here 
mwahahahahahahah!
