My dear fellow-citizens, 
this is a serious matter!
The demons having been hidden
in the shadows during 
several hundred years have 
awakened and above all,
they have captured 
the people of Vailor and the Princess. 
After several weeks of scouting 
we managed to locate them.
According to the reports of our soldiers, 
the demons had set up three camps.
One in the old mine east of Vailor, 
one in the Temple of Fortune,
and one under the Vailor Cemetery. 
Young Soldiers, 
give your bodies and souls 
to save our nation,
and go and root out these Demons. 
Save the Princess.
